# CMSC 416 Spring 2022

**Summary of Projects :**

The folders above are NLP school projects done in Python. 

Both were implemented similarly with the use of a supervised machine learning approach. A training corpus is read in to be used as a model for the program to learn from, which is later used on a test file for predictions. A scorer was also created to compare results to the most frequent baseline and displays a confusion matrix.
