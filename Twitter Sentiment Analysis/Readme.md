# Programming Assignment 5: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

**Summary**

This program performs positive/negative sentiment analysis over tweets downloaded from twitter. A bag-of-words representation of the training data and other features were used as a model for our program to learn from. Using this model, the program reads an unannotated corpus and predicts whether a tweet is more positive or negative in sentiment. The accuracy of the model can be seen within the description of sentiment.py
